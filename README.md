# Popongong

![demo](./demo.gif "Demo")

Hobby project to learn rust and SDL2. Sound effects are all from garage band.

# Controls
* Esc - quit
* Space - pause/play
* W/S - left paddles up/down
* Up/Down - right paddles up/down

# How do I run it?
Until I put stable releases somewhere your best bet is to install rust, clone this repo, and try and build it.
